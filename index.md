Hi, I am Alexander Dilthey. I just started a research group at the [Institute of Medical Microbiology](http://www.uniklinik-duesseldorf.de/en/unternehmen/institute/institute-of-medical-microbiology/) at the University Hospital of Dusseldorf. We'll soon be hiring - get in touch if you want to work on Population Reference Graphs, Nanopore-based clinical diagnostics or long-read metagenomics.

I developed [HLA\*IMP:02](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002877), which has enabled HLA typing of millions of samples, and [HLA\*PRG](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005151), which enables near-perfect HLA typing from standard sequencing data. I was part of the team that [showed](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v47/n6/full/ng.3257.html) that Population Reference Graphs improve genome inference in complex regions of the human genome. During my time at the NIH as member of the [Phillippy group](https://genomeinformatics.github.io), I have also become interested in long reads and microbes.

I am always interested in the development of new technologies and have co-founded two companies, [Peptide Groove LLP](http://www.peptidegroove.com/) (statistical HLA genotyping) and Lighthouse Cancer Diagnostics Ltd (cfDNA-based cancer screening technologies). During high school and undergrad, I moonlighted as a computer programmer and ran websites about gaming and web programming.

I care about free speech and the free exchange of ideas. At Oxford, I co-founded a [British-German conference series](http://www.oxfordgermanforum.org/). At Dusseldorf, I was co-president of [debate!](http://www.debate.de/), the university's debating society.
