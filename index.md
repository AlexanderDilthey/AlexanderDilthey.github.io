Hi, I am Alexander Dilthey, currently a Visiting Research Fellow at [NHGRI-NIH](http://genome.gov).

I developed [HLA\*IMP:02](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002877), which was used to determine the HLA types of millions of samples, and [HLA\*PRG](https://github.com/AlexanderDilthey/HLA-PRG-LA), which enables near-perfect HLA typing from standard sequencing data. I was part of the team that [showed](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v47/n6/full/ng.3257.html) that Population Reference Graphs can improve genome inference in complex regions of the human genome.

I am always interested in the development of new technologies and co-founded two companies, [Peptide Groove LLP](http://www.peptidegroove.com/) (statistical HLA genotyping) and Lighthouse Cancer Diagnostics Ltd (cfDNA-based cancer screening technologies). During high school and my undergrad, I moonlighted as a computer programmer and ran websites about gaming and web programming.

I care about free speech and the free exchange of ideas. At Oxford, I co-founded a [British-German conference series](http://www.oxfordgermanforum.org/). During my undergrad, I was co-president of [debate!](http://www.debate.de/), the debating society at the Heinrich-Heine-University.
